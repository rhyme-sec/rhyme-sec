# Hello!

I'm a security researcher with several years of experience in Linux system administration, network security, and vulnerability assessment. I'm currently exploring various areas of Linux security, such as kernel security, container security, and cloud security.


## Goals
My main goal is to contribute to the Linux security community by creating and improving tools, techniques, and best practices that can help make Linux systems more secure. I'm also interested in collaborating with other security researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and work together on security-related projects.

Thank You for Reading!
